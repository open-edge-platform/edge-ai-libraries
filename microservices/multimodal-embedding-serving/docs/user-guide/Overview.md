# Multimodal Embedding Serving microservice
The Multimodal Embedding Serving microservice provides a scalable and efficient means to generate joint image and text embeddings using the CLIP model. It enables applications to perform cross-modal search, retrieval, and similarity tasks by exposing CLIPâ€™s powerful vision-language understanding as a simple, production-ready service. 

# Overview
The microservice is a simple model serving to be able to do inference using CLIP model on a GPU or CPU hardware. It provides OpenAI standard API along with ability to deploy as a docker image or using Helm chart.
