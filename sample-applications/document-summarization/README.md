# Document Summarization Sample Application

The Document Summarization Sample Application demonstrates how to leverage the LlamaIndex framework, a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs), to generate concise and informative summaries from long-form documents. By integrating LlamaIndex framework, the application efficiently processes and understands textual content, enabling users to extract key information and insights from a variety of document types. This approach streamlines content review, enhances searchability, and supports advanced use cases such as knowledge management and automated reporting.
