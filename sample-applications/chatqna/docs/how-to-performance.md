# How to Test Performance

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the performance of the ChatQ&A Sample Application.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- The ChatQ&A Sample Application is set up and running. Refer to the [Get Started](./get-started.md) guide for setup instructions.

## Steps to Test Performance

1. **Set Up Performance Testing Tools**:
    - Install necessary performance testing tools such as Apache JMeter or Locust:
      ```bash
      pip install locust
      ```

2. **Create a Performance Test Script**:
    - Create a performance test script to simulate user queries. For example, using Locust:
      ```python
      from locust import HttpUser, task, between

      class ChatQnAPerformanceTest(HttpUser):
          wait_time = between(1, 5)

          @task
          def ask_query(self):
              self.client.post("/api/query", json={"question": "What is the capital of France?"})
      ```

3. **Run the Performance Test**:
    - Run the performance test script:
      ```bash
      locust -f performance_test.py --host http://{host_ip}:5173
      ```

4. **Monitor Performance Metrics**:
    - Monitor key performance metrics such as latency and throughput using the performance testing tool's dashboard.

## Key Performance Metrics

### Latency
- **Definition**: The time taken to generate a response to a user query.
- **Measurement**: Measure the response time for each query during the performance test.

### Throughput
- **Definition**: The number of queries processed per second.
- **Measurement**: Measure the number of queries processed per second during the performance test.

## Verification
- Ensure that the application meets the expected performance criteria by analyzing the performance test results.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues during the performance testing process, check the application logs for errors:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```
