## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Required Environment Variables

<a name="required-env"></a>

Before running the application, you need to set several environment variables:

1. **Registry Configuration**:
   The application uses registry URL, project name, and tag to pull or build required images.

    ```bash
    export REGISTRY_URL=<your-container-registry-url>    # e.g. "docker.io/username/"
    export PROJECT_NAME=<your-project-name>              # e.g. "video-search-and-summary""
    export TAG=<your-tag>                                # e.g. "rc4" or "latest"
    ```

   > **_IMPORTANT:_** These variables control how image names are constructed. If `REGISTRY_URL` is **docker.io/username/** and `PROJECT_NAME` is **video-summary**, an image would be pulled or built as **docker.io/username/video-summary/<application-name>:tag**. The `<application-name>` is hardcoded in _image_ field of each service in all docker compose files. If `REGISTRY_URL` or `PROJECT_NAME` are not set, blank string will be used to construct the image name. If `TAG` is not set, **latest** will be used by default.

2. **Required credentials for some services**:
   Following variables **MUST** be set on your current shell before running the setup script:

    ```bash
    # MinIO credentials (object storage)
    export MINIO_ROOT_USER=<your-minio-username>
    export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-minio-password>

    # PostgreSQL credentials (database)
    export POSTGRES_USER=<your-postgres-username>
    export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-postgres-password>

    # RabbitMQ credentials (message broker)
    export RABBITMQ_USER=<your-rabbitmq-username>
    export RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=<your-rabbitmq-password>
    ```

3. **Setting environment variables for customizing model selection**:

    These environment variables **MUST** be set on your current shell. Setting these variables help you customize which models are used for deployment.

    ```bash
    # For VLM-based chunk captioning and video summary on CPU
    export VLM_MODEL_NAME="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct"  # or any other supported VLM model on CPU

    # For VLM-based chunk captioning and video summary on GPU
    export VLM_MODEL_NAME="microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct"  # or any other supported VLM model on GPU

    # (Optional) For OVMS-based video summary (when using with ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY=true or ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU=true)
    export OVMS_LLM_MODEL_NAME="Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3"  # or any other supported LLM model

    # Model used by Audio Analyzer service. Only Whisper models variants are supported.
    # Common Supported models: tiny.en, small.en, medium.en, base.en, large-v1, large-v2, large-v3.
    # You can provide just one or comma-separated list of models.
    export ENABLED_WHISPER_MODELS="tiny.en,small.en,medium.en"

    # Object detection model used for Video Ingestion Service. Only Yolo models are supported.
    export OD_MODEL_NAME="yolov8l-worldv2"

    # Multimodal embedding model. Only openai/clip-vit-base models are supported
    export VCLIP_MODEL=openai/clip-vit-base-patch32
    ```

4. **Advanced VLM Configuration Options**:

    The following environment variables provide additional control over VLM inference behavior and logging:

    ```bash
    # (Optional) OpenVINO Configuration for VLM inference optimization
    # Pass OpenVINO configuration parameters as a JSON string to fine-tune inference performance
    # Default latency-optimized configuration (equivalent to not setting OV_CONFIG)
    # export OV_CONFIG='{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "LATENCY"}'

    # Throughput-optimized configuration
    export OV_CONFIG='{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "THROUGHPUT"}'

    # Custom configuration with multiple streams and threads
    # export OV_CONFIG='{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "THROUGHPUT", "NUM_STREAMS": 4, "INFERENCE_NUM_THREADS": 8}'

    # Configuration with cache directory
    # export OV_CONFIG='{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "LATENCY", "CACHE_DIR": "/tmp/ov_cache"}'
    ```

    > **_IMPORTANT:_** The `OV_CONFIG` variable is used to pass OpenVINO configuration parameters to the VLM service. It allows you to optimize inference performance based on your hardware and workload.
    > For a complete list of OpenVINO configuration options, refer to the [OpenVINO Documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes.html).
    > **Note**: If OV_CONFIG is not set, the default configuration `{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "LATENCY"}` will be used.

**üîê Working with Gated Models**

   To run a **GATED MODEL** like Llama models, the user will need to pass their [huggingface token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens#user-access-tokens). The user will need to request access to specific model by going to the respective model page on HuggingFace.

   Go to <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens> to get your token.

   ```bash
   export GATED_MODEL=true
   export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>
   ```

Once exported, run the setup script as mentioned [here](#running-app). Please switch off the `GATED_MODEL` flag by running `export GATED_MODEL=false`, once you are no more using gated models. This avoids unnecessary authentication step during setup.

## üìä Application Stacks Overview

The Video Summary application offers multiple stacks and deployment options:

| Stack | Description | Flag (used with setup script) |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Video Summary | Video frame captioning and Summary | `--summary` |
| Video Search | Video indexing and semantic search | `--search` |
| Video Search + Summary **_(Under Construction)_** | Both summary and search capabilities | `--all` |

### üß© Deployment Options for Video Summary

| Option | Chunk-Wise Summary | Final Summary | Environment Variables | Recommended Models |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| VLM-CPU |vlm-openvino-serving on CPU | vlm-openvino-serving on CPU | Default | VLM: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct` |
| VLM-GPU | vlm-openvino-serving |vlm-openvino-serving GPU | `ENABLE_VLM_GPU=true` | VLM: `microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct` |
| VLM-OVMS-CPU | vlm-openvino-serving on CPU | OVMS Microservice on CPU | `ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY=true` | VLM: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`<br>LLM: `Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3` |
| VLM-CPU-OVMS-GPU | vlm-openvino-serving on CPU | OVMS Microservice on GPU | `ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU=true` | VLM: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`<br>LLM: `Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3` |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

<a name="running-app"></a>

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git
    cd edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/video-search-and-summarization
    ```

2. Set the required environment variables as described  [above](#required-env).

3. Run the setup script with the appropriate flag, depending on your use case.

   > NOTE: Before switching to a different mode always stop the current application stack by running:

   ```bash
   source setup.sh --down
   ```

- **To run Video Summary only:**

    ```bash
    source setup.sh --summary
    ```

- **To run Video Search only:**

    ```bash
    source setup.sh --search
    ```

- **To run Video Summary with OVMS Microservice for final summary :**

    ```bash
    ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY=true source setup.sh --summary
    ```

4. (Optional) Verify the resolved environment variables and setup configurations.

    ```bash
    # To just set environment variables without starting containers
    source setup.sh --setenv

    # To see resolved configurations for summary services without starting containers
    source setup.sh --summary config

    # To see resolved configurations for search services without starting containers
    source setup.sh --search config

    # To see resolved configurations for both search and summary services combined without starting containers
    source setup.sh --all config

    # To see resolved configurations for summary services with OVMS setup on CPU without starting containers
    ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY=true source setup.sh --summary config
    ```

### ‚ö° Using GPU Acceleration

To use GPU acceleration for VLM inference:

   > NOTE: Before switching to a different mode always stop the current application stack by running:

   ```bash
   source setup.sh --down
   ```

```bash
ENABLE_VLM_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary
```

To use GPU acceleration for OVMS-based summary:

```bash
ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary
```

To use GPU acceleration for vclip-embedding-ms for search usecase:

```bash
ENABLE_EMBEDDING_GPU=true source setup.sh --search
```

To verify configuration and resolved environment variables without running the application:

```bash
# For VLM inference on GPU
ENABLE_VLM_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary config
```

```bash
# For OVMS inference on GPU
ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary config
```

```bash
# For vclip-embedding-ms on GPU
ENABLE_EMBEDDING_GPU=true source setup.sh --search config
```

> **_NOTE:_** Please avoid setting `ENABLE_VLM_GPU`, `ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU`, or `ENABLE_EMBEDDING_GPU` explicitly on shell using `export`, as you need to switch these flags off as well, to return back to CPU configuration.
