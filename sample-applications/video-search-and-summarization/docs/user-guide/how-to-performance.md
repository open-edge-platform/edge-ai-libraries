- **Measurement**: Measure the response time for each query during the performance test.

### Throughput
- **Definition**: The number of queries processed per second.
- **Measurement**: Measure the number of queries processed per second during the performance test.

## Verification
- Ensure that the application meets the expected performance criteria by analyzing the performance test results.
