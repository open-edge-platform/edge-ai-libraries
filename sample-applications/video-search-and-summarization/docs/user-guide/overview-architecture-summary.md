# Video Summary Architecture Overview

The Video Summary pipeline allows developers to deploy video summary capability in an on-prem environment and feeding on the private video. The application is built on a modular microservices approach and is intended to be scalable and customizable across multiple industry segment specific deployments. This page provides a technical overview of the applicationâ€™s architecture, components, and extensibility.

## Architecture
The system architecture diagram shows the Video Summary pipeline and its constituent components. Following is a high-level overview of the components.

1. **Video Summarization UI**: A reference UI is provided for the users to interact with and exercise all capabilities of the video summary application. 

2. **Video Summarization pipeline manager**: The pipeline manager is the central orchestrator of the summary pipeline. It receives the requests from the UI and uses the other set of microservices to deliver the summary capability. It provides for asynchronous handling of the video.

3. **Video Ingestion**: This microservice is responsible for ingesting videos that need to be summarized. The ingestion microservice is based on Intel DLStreamer pipeline and utilises the DLStreamer pipeline server to manage the video pipeline. The video ingestion microservice allows ingestion of common video formats. The ingestion microservice creates video chunks, extracts configured frames from it, passes the frame(s) through object detection and outputs all of the metadata and the video chunks to the object store.  

4. **VLM as the captioning block**: The VLM microservice is responsible for generating captions for the specific video chunk. The VLM accepts prompts which also includes additional information from configured capabilities (like object detection) and generates the caption. The caption information is stored to the object store.

5. **LLM as the summarizer of captions**: The LLM microservice is used to generate the summary of the individual captions. It is also possible to use the LLM to summarize at a chunk level (captions of individual frames of the chunk) but it is optional.

6. **Audio transcription**: The Audio transcription microservice helps create a transcription of the audio channel in the given video. The extracted audio transcription serves as another source of rich metadata that can be used both as an input to VLM and separately as text data to enrich the summary.

Video Summary application is a customizable pipeline that provides varied capabilities to meet different deployment requirements. The capabilities ensures a rich contextual and perceptual analysis of video during the summary process thereby providing qualitatively richer summary of the given video. The figures below illustrates the setup. The Video summary UI communicates with the Video summary pipeline manager microservice to feed the video to be summarized and provide continuous update through the summary process. The UI allows the user to configure the specific capabilities required in the summary pipeline as in the examples shown in figure 1. The pipeline manager is responsible for managing the user requests and dynamically configure a functional pipeline corresponding to the user request.

The VLM, LLM, and Embedding microservices are provided as part of Intel Edge AI inference microservices catalog supporting a rich set of open-source models that can be downloaded from popular model hubs like [Hugging Face OpenVINO](https://huggingface.co/OpenVINO). The video ingestion microservice provides capability to ingest common video formats, chunk the video, feed the extracted frames to configurable capabilities like object detection, and provide the output of it to the VLM microservice for captioning. The individual captions are then summarized at the end by the LLM microservice to provide the final summary of the video. The audio transcription microservice provides ability to transcribe the audio using Whisper model. An object store is used to save the raw videos, frames, and generated metadata.

### Application Flow
The application flow involves the following steps:

1. **Create the video summary pipeline**
   - **Configure the pipeline**: The _video summarization UI microservice_ provides the user a means to configure the different capabilities required on the summary pipeline. A separate user guide is planned to provide all required details on how to setup the pipeline.
   - **Create the pipeline**: The configuration done on the UI is received by the _Video summarization pipeline manager microservice_. The pipeline manager configures the required microservices as per the capabilities and configuration requested by the user.    
2. **Input Video Sources**:
   - **Provide video**: The user provides the source of the video to be summarized. The UI provides means to configure the input video. Currently, only offline video processing is supported by reading from local storage. In future, live camera streaming support will also be provided. The pipeline manager stores the video into a local object store.
   - **Ingest video**: The stored video is then consumed by the _video ingestion microservice_. The video ingestion microservice reuses DL Streamer pipeline server and all its capabilities to provide for different features like object detection, audio classification, and (in future) input feed from live cameras. The ingestion process involves decode, chunking, and selection of frame(s) from the input video. The extracted frame(s) is passed through object detection blocks, audio classification block if they are configured. The extracted frames along with the metadata returned by the object detector and/or audio classification is then passed to the VLM microservice.
   - **Audio transcription**: The video is demuxed and audio extracted for transcription. Using the object store, the audio is fed to the _Audio transcription microservice_ and transcription is created. This transcription is used to feed to the caption part of process as well as stored in the object store for latter stage processing.
3. **Create Caption for given frame(s)**
   - **VLM microservice**: The extracted frame(s) along with the prompt and metadata returned from the object detector and/or audio classification is passed to the _vlm-ov-serving_ for captioning. Depending on the configuration and compute availability, batch captioning is also supported. To optimize for performance, the captioning is done in parallel with the video ingestion.
   - **VLM model selection**: The capability of the VLM microservice is dependent on the VLM model used. Example, multi-frame caption by maintaining a context between frames is a function of the chosen model. In addition, the prompt passed has a significant implication on the quality of the output of the VLM.
   - **Store the captions**: The generated captions along with all the metadata generated in the pipeline is stored in a local object store. During store, necessary relationship information between the stored data is also maintained.
4. **Create summary of all captions**:
   - **LLM microservice**: After all the captions are summarized, the _LLM microservice_ is used to create a summary of all individual captions. The selection of LLM model has an impact on the accuracy of the summary created.
5. **Observability dashboard**: 
   - If set up, the dashboard displays real-time logs, metrics, and traces providing a view of the performance, accuracy, and resource consumption by the application..
