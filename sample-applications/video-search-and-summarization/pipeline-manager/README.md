# Pipeline Manager Service

## Overview
The Pipeline Manager Service is a core component of the Intel EGAI Video Summary application. It manages the video processing pipeline, coordinating various services to generate video summaries.

## Features
- Manages video processing pipeline
- Coordinates with other services like Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server, OVMS, VLM, RabbitMQ, and Minio
- Call minio service to save the Videos.
- Call Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server service to Ingest Videos
- Read the status from the RabbitMQ Queue
- Sends frames to VLM Service for Frame Captioning
- Send Chunks to LLM Service for Chunk Captioning
- Send Chunk Captions to LLM Service for Video Summarization.
- Handles video uploads and state management

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
